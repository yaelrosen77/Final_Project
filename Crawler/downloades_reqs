Todo:
registraion opertaion:
first step- register to a blue link
second step- mark R on the table
third step- check which properties should be pressed for inserting text
forth step- see if after all of it- the website returns directly to the original link

replace the pre-class column with some flags that can indicate handling tasks
check out if there is a class attribute in red also try a.something
see whether delaying download by second will help (yellow case) or check if is the right link
for links of type upload can upload and download the same file
for links that are under drop down check if they change URL
add some manually popular links pcaps
check wheter we can download by content inside the href and place it in the excel
registration under google account- add in code logic
for the pink case add some more clicks for it
for classes with multiple words-> just add dots between each word like in line 111
add ten more links and all exterior links that work
maybe apps with google viggene cause problems
if there is a problem with clickable class but there is id than try with # before the id content

if all downloads work propely - add 5 more files to upload intechangebly or for each link do all the files
