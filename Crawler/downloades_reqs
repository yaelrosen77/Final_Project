EXCEL MARKS
Blue = requires registration
Red = not under clickable class
Green = verified
Purple = failed on non-bots verification
Orange = Doesnt include download links - replace or add some upload
Yellow = manually can be download but in chromium just opens or there are several links and it marks the first one
Pink = clickable class is under drop-down or other pop-up window


Todo:
cancel pre-class col inside the code and the file
check out if there is a class attribute in red
see whether delaying download by second will help (yellow case)
for links of type upload can upload and download the same file
for links that are under drop down check if they change URL
add some manually popular links pcaps
