EXCEL MARKS
Blue = requires registration
Red = not under clickable class
Green = verified
Purple = failed on non-bots verification or cookies
Orange = Doesnt include download links or doesnt even opens- replace or add some upload
Yellow = manually can be download but in chromium just opens or there are several links and it marks the first one
Pink = clickable class is under drop-down or other pop-up window


Todo:
cancel pre-class col inside the code and the file
check out if there is a class attribute in red
see whether delaying download by second will help (yellow case) or check if is the right link
for links of type upload can upload and download the same file
for links that are under drop down check if they change URL
add some manually popular links pcaps
check wheter we can download by content inside the href and place it in the excel
registration under google account- add in code logic
for the pink case add some more clicks for it
for classes with multiple words-> just add dots between each word like in line 111
add ten more links and all exterior links that work
maybe apps with google viggene cause problems
